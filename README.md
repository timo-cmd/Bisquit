This is the official repository for "build your own blockchain in Julia", an article I'm writing to teach peoples understanding blockchain better by inplementing their own one by using the Julia programming language.

The code in this repo is still under construction and all pre-alpha so I'd suggest you shouldn't touch it yet.
